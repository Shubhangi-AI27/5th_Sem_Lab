ðŸ“ŒProject Overview

Objective: To predict whether a patient is likely to survive cancer based on input features.

Methodology: Supervised binary classification using Logistic Regression.

Dataset: Cancer_Data.csv â€” includes relevant patient attributes and survival labels.

Performance: The model achieves an accuracy of 97% on the test data.

Evaluation

Model performance was assessed using a Confusion Matrix, which illustrates the distribution of true positives, false positives, true negatives, 
and false negatives. This provides a clearer understanding of classification quality beyond raw accuracy.
